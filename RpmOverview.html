   Map</b></big> <br>
             </div>
             <br>
       Relational perspective map (RPM), developed by James X. Li[1] is a general purpose
   method for visualizing distance information of data points in high dimensional
   spaces. <br>
             <br>
       The starting point of the RPM algorithm is a set of data point<i>
s<sub>i,</sub></i><i>    i</i>=1,...,<i>N</i>, and a distance matrix <i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i>.
The matrix&nbsp;<i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i>,  called the relational distance, is
the numeric representation of a relationship  between the data points. The
goal of the RPM algorithm is to map the data  points <i>s<sub>i</sub></i>
into a two or three dimensional map so that Euclidean  distances <i>d<sub>ij</sub></i> 
between the image points visually approaches        <i>&#948;<sub>ij </sub></i>as 
much as possible. The resulting lower dimensional  map is called Relational Perspective Map, the matrix <i>d<sub>ij</sub></i>  is called the Image Distance Matrix. From geometric point of view, an RPM map attempts to preserve as much 
as possible the distance information within the original  dataset.<br>
             <br>
       The following figure demonstrates how the RPM algorithm works to create 2D maps: 
  it first maps data points to the surface of a torus, then unfolds the torus
   surface by a vertical and a horizontal cut. This second step is relatively&nbsp;straightforward (see <a href="index.html?UnwrappingTorus" target="_blank">here</a> for a short video showing the transformation between
 rectangle and torus), the innovation of the RPM algorithm lies in mapping the data
points  to the torus surface so that the distances between the image points
resembles  the distances between data points.<br>
             <br>

       &nbsp; <br>
             </div>
             <br>
       In order the find the best mapping, the RPM algorithm defines an energy 
function   as follows:<br>
                                                       
      <div align="center"><img alt="RPM energy function" src="/images/RpmEnergyForm.png" height="70" width="380">
       &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
             </div>
       where <i>p </i>is an algorithm parameter called the rigidity, <i>d<sub>ij 
         </sub>&nbsp;</i>is the geodesic block distance between two image 
points  on the torus surface. The RPM algorithm then uses gradient descent 
optimization  method to find the lowest-energy configuration. The rigidity 
parameter,  which is normally a value between -1 and +1, alters the energy 
landscape in a global manner, so that the resulting RPM maps have different 
characteristics.<br>
             <br>
       To better understand the RPM algorithm it is helpful to consider the 
 image  points on the torus as a force-directed, multi-particale system with 
 mutual  repulsive forces between them; and consider the energy&nbsp;<i>E<sub>p</sub></i> 
   as a kind of total potential energy. According to physics, the repulsive
   force is characterized as proportional to relational distance: <br>
             <br>
                                                       
      <div align="center"><img alt="Force directing RPM simulations" src="/images/RpmForceForm.png" height="68" width="120">
       <br>
             <br>
                                                       
      <div align="left">The optimization strategy is to minimize the energy&nbsp;<i>E<sub>p</sub></i> by&nbsp;simulating a&nbsp;dynamic system directed by the force given by above form. Since
points    with larger relational distances between them correspond to larger
repulsive    force on the torus, their image points on the torus should &nbsp;be
further    apart from each other.<br>
             </div>
             </div>
             <br>
The key idea of RPM algorithm is its exploitation of the properties of
closed manifold (the torus) to keep the configuration in balance.
(Competing approaches are identified in the next section.) Whereas
other non-linear methods apply, directly or indirectly, attractive
force to map closely related points to closely located positions,
&nbsp;the RPM algorithm maps closely related points within a closely
located area by modeling the collective repulsive force of all points.
This approach makes&nbsp;RPM a true, and&nbsp;(as far as we know) the
only, global mapping algorithm. <br>
             <br>It should be noted here that the RPM
algorithm relaxes one condition of the original problem setting: the
resulting map is not a normal rectangle, but a torus. This means that
the opposite edges of the map
should be considered as contiguous or joined.<br>

       Visualizing high dimensional data has been a major topic since many
 decades.   A large group of methods target high dimensional data with sophisticated
  rendering techniques like 3D landscapes, special glyphs, colors, and graphics
  etc. Other methods approach the problem by reducing the dimensionality in
a  generic way with few&nbsp;assumptions about data type. RPM algorithm belongs
  to the latter group. The following is a short list of methods that&nbsp;directly
  or indirectly reduce data dimensionality: <br>
